/**
 * jlib digital representation of objects, for instance, digits of a
 * digital clock. A DigitalObject is formed by DigitalElements which may
 * be set active or inactive. The set of DigitalElements forming a DigitalObject
 * is only restricted by the number of existing instances of the DigitalElement
 * interface. Commonly, this class is parameterized by an enumeration type
 * defining the DigitalElements forming the DigitalObjects.
